            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>In the era of Covid-19 there’s a sudden spike in people’s interest to learn new things.These things include new hobbies
            such as playing an instrument,learning a new technology and the most common one being baking and trying to cook new
            dishes.
            
            My sister is a baker and a food photographer by profession and she needs a website to showcase her recipes and the
            photos taken by her.So I decided to create a website that serves as a recipe and a portfolio website.
            The users will be able to view the recipes and comment on it and also save the recipes for viewing later.I hope this
            website will enable the world to see my sister’s works.
